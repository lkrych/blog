**Introduction**

Hey there, in this post I am going to teach you how to set up and deploy a blog just like mine ðŸ˜Š.

First, some historical context that will explain some of the tools I chose to use. Before creating this site I blogged on [wordpress](https://lelandkrych.wordpress.com). Wordpress works well and I recommend it for beginners. *You don't really need to think, you just need to write.* I imagine that this pretty similar to blogging on Medium.
